# Easy DynamoDB

This module is designed to reduce the effort required to get up and running with DynamoDB and make it a bit more friendly to use than the standard DynamoDB DocumentClient. While this is a lot easier to use than basic DynamoDB it is generally still quite complex as it uses a lot of somewhat confusing language of the DynamoDB API still, documentation of the Document Client can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB/DocumentClient.html).
